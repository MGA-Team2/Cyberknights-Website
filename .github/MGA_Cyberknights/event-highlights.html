            <h3>Cyberknights Are Four Of Top 10 In Major Cybersecurity Competition (2021)</h3>
            <p class='tab'>
                Current or recently graduated Cyberknights students made up four of the top 10 finalists in the 2020 “Secure the Future” event, a grueling multi-month academic competition where contestants come up with strategies to fight major cybersecurity threats.
                The students/alumni are Victor Fordham, captain of MGA’s CyberKnights organization; Kartavya Trivedi; Caleb Knight; and Laurent Espinosa.
                As the competition’s third-place winner, Trivedi won a $2,500 cash prize.
            </p>
            <p class='tab'>
                “Secure the Future” competitors chose different industry sectors, such as energy, healthcare, or finance, and developed reports, videos, and presentations related to protecting operational assets through the analysis, comparison, and selection of advanced security tools, methodologies, and implementation options.
                Participants were tasked to come up with approaches for deploying end-to-end attack detection, alert triage, threat hunting, investigation, orchestration, and automated response activities.
                In February 2021, all top 10 finalists presented their findings and methodologies to Palo Alto engineers, managers, and directors.
